**Please note that you must submit your homework both in Replit and here in Canvas. ( Your program will be manually inspected to make sure that you have implemented the code using generics)**

Please note that all homeworks are due on Monday. Plus you get two days without any penalty. That means, this homework is set to close on Wednesday midnight.  Since, Replit allows me to enter only one date, you see Wedneday date as due date.

Also, please put your name in the Java program. Failing to do so will result in -10 points.

Please read all instructions carefully and go through the sample input output formatting requirements before attempting to do the work.

Your program will be graded based on the following rubrics:

1. Formatting requirements 10%

2. Functional requirements. 70%

3. Logical flow requirements 20%

**Description**

3. Create an Employee Class that stores an Employees ID number and name.

Then create an EmployeeMap class that allows you to add Employee objects and look them up by their ID numbers.

The EmployeeMap class should use Map object to map ID numbers to Employee objects.

Create an application to demonstrate the classes.

Please create following employees with ids shown.

employeeMap.add(new Employee(1,"Eason"));

employeeMap.add(new Employee(2,"Lisa"));

employeeMap.add(new Employee(3,"Anna"));

employeeMap.add(new Employee(4,"Olivia"));

employeeMap.add(new Employee(5,"Madelyn"));

employeeMap.add(new Employee(6,"Sam"));

employeeMap.add(new Employee(7,"Will"));

employeeMap.add(new Employee(8,"Johnson"));

The java file name must be **EmployeeMap.java**

**Here are further  input output samples:**
